This is the backend part of a larger project I worked on, within a collective project. I was part of a team of 10 people and we had to make an application of our choice. We chose to implement an application where you can make exchanges and donations, this being divided into three subprojects, carried out by smaller teams: backend (approx. 4 people), frontend (approx. 4 people) and testing (approx. 2 people). During the project, we were also guided by a mentor from a partner company, who gave us advice and made sure that we were handling the project.

To create the backend part that I worked on, I used the Java language together with a PostgreSQL database, along with other technologies and libraries such as Spring, JPA, Docker, Liquibase, Lombok and many others. In order to organize ourselves as best as possible, we used GitLab where we added tasks for each person and then solved them.
